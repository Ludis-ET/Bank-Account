
## Pseudocode
1. Initialize variables: total_numbers, count, logged_in_user, manager_password, manager_account, system_constant, manager_balance, login_acc,
login_pin, my_acc, new_acc, new_balance, transaction, check_user, and terminate to their respective values.

2. Initialize a 2D array account with total_numbers rows and 2 columns, and a float array balance with total_numbers elements. Set the first 
element of account to [manager_account, manager_password] and the first element of balance to manager_balance.

3. Start a while loop that continues as long as terminate is false. a. Display the main menu with options for creating a new account, balance
inquiry, deposit, withdrawal, closing an account, and accessing the manager pannel. b. Get the user's transaction choice and convert it to uppercase.
c. If the transaction choice is 'O' (create new account):

4.If count is less than total_numbers:
 If the user is logged in:
 Print a message indicating that a new account cannot be created while logged in.
5.Else:
 While the login pin is less than 100 or greater than or equal to 1000 or the new balance is less than or equal to 10:
 Ask the user to choose a 3-digit pin code that starts without 0 and deposit an amount greater than 10.
 Set new_acc to manager_account + count.
 Print a message indicating that the account has been created successfully and display the account number and pin.
 Set the account number, pin, and balance for the current count in the account and balance arrays.
 Increment the count and logged_in_user variables.
6.Else:
 Print a message indicating that the maximum number of accounts has been reached. c. If the transaction choice is not 'O':
 If the user is not logged in:
 Ask the user to enter their account number.
 If the account number does not exist:
 Print a message indicating that no account was found and continue to the next iteration of the while loop.
